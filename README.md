# SystemAnalysisAndDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client Driverpass wanted to develop a system that would help improve the overall education and cultivation of drivers that went through their system. They had needed a system designed to help customers schedule classes and appointments with drivers as well as be able to take tests online. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think what I did particularly well was in the Systems Design Document as I really liked creating the diagrams. It was a lot of fun for me to graphically map the requirements because it was easier for me to understand and comprehend from a logical standpoint.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that I definitely could have put more into understanding the different diagrams, I feel as if there was a lot more that I could have included into the system and there is a lot more work that has to be done to create the entirety of a system like this throughout the lifecycle of the system design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The way I interpreted the user's needs were through the translation of these requirements to a hardware and software level through the creation of functions that would solve the initial issues discussed. One reason it is so important to consider the user's needs when designing is because in the case you are solving an issue, there maybe a specified way of solving the issue that the client is discussing. For example, if you had found a bug in security, but had overlooked that the client had not wanted to deal with security so they outsourced it to the cloud, taking the time to investigate this type of issue could potentially waste resources towards other functions in the system that need to be developed for the overall functionality. This instead should have been reported to the cloud service in a detailed report to help solve the problem while maintaining the general focus on the main project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The way I approach designing software comes from an outside view of the whole system. Once we have enough information to create a direction we can start looking at other features such as the different types of architectures of design, what kind of languages we can use, and what kind of frameworks we can use to deploy the application during runtime. I think this really helps us decide the direction of the design lifecycle because we can take everything into consideration and fully account for the types of tools and patterns we will need.
